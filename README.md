# FormsApp

A basic ASP.NET Core MVC practice project focusing on:

- What is a Form?
- GET Form
- POST Form
- Form Tag Helpers
- Model Binding
- Form Validations
- File Upload
- Create Form
- Edit Form
- Delete Product
- Batch Update

This project was created to improve my ASP.NET Core MVC skills by practicing form handling and model interaction.
